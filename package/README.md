# MaterialPro Angular with Data Classifiers Example

This repo uses MaterialPro Angular (Lite) and adds a demo page that matches a "Data Classifiers" UI similar to the screenshot provided.

## Quick start

1) Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

2) Start dev server
```
npm start
```

3) Open the Data Classifiers page

Navigate to `/dashboard/data-classifiers` or click "Data Classifiers" under the "Data" section in the sidebar.

## Implementation notes

- Page location: `src/app/pages/data-classifiers/`
- Routes wired in: `src/app/pages/pages.routes.ts`
- Mocked data is used for the table and details. Swap with real APIs as needed.
